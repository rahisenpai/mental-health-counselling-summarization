Right? So she's gone to live with her dad that quite recently,routine,208_64,T,irq,amusement
a year ago,routine,208_65,P,id,amusement
and what was what was that about?,routine,208_66,T,irq,amusement
she just couldn't cope with the fact that I was cutting myself might run into friends. She knew it was happening. And I suppose I suppose one of the big things as well as relationships I have,symp/reasoning,208_67,P,id,amusement
the relationships you had?,routine,208_68,T,yq,amusement
Hmm,routine,208_69,P,ack,amusement
Can you tell me a bit more about that?,symp/reasoning,208_70,T,irq,amusement

"Okay. Well, there are lots of relationships like that. ",inactive,208_74,T,gc,amusement
Yeah.,inactive,208_75,P,ack,amusement
Okay. You've seen Jane a few people in the past you've seen a couple of psychiatrists and a couple of counselors. As anything that anyone's done for you before been particularly helpful.,symp/reasoning,208_76,T,gc,amusement
I've been crap was Philip being passed from pillar to post.,routine,208_77,P,gc,amusement
So you've not found anything that people have done particularly helpful in helping you to manage your relationships and your cutting and the things that seem to go wrong for you.,symp/reasoning,208_78,T,crq,amusement
"Its llike nobody's listening to me, You know, I think you're the only person who's actually sat and listened to what I've got to say,",symp/reasoning,208_79,P,cd,amusement
"what do you think it would be worse? Given that this this has been such a long standing problem clearly does get gets in the way, quite a lot of aspects of your life. Do you think it would be worth us? meeting again one more time, and perhaps having a think together about how the service could best support you with this?",routine,208_80,T,orq,amusement
"What do you mean one more time? Can I see you, you know, properly. ",routine,208_81,P,crq,amusement
"Well, the way that we work here in this department is that we we see people once or twice and try and think with them about the best place for them to be and then refer them on to the most appropriate parts of the service. So it wouldn't be usual for me to see. See you more than once or twice Strain",routine,208_82,T,cd,amusement
"Yeah like I said, You're the only person that's listened to me.",,208_83,P,od,amusement
I know it's very difficult to open up to people and I know that you have opened up here today and it can feel quite hard that you're not going to continue to see me but it is the way that we work here is to pass you on to somebody who is perhaps a bit more appropriate for your needs Jane. So would it be okay for me to book you in to come back and see me say next week for a second appointment and we can perhaps have a think of where to go from there.,routine,208_84,T,gc,amusement
That'd be okay.,inactive,208_85,P,gc,amusement
