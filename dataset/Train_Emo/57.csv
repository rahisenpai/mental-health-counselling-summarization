summary,"The patient worries a lot when in social situtations, visibly shake, red and sweating. The patient tries to clench on their muscles and find something to focus on or look down and they prefer wearing black to be less obvious of worrying. The therapist requests the patient for a role-play of these situations to be enacted. On enacting the patient rates 90 on 100 for all her symptoms by doing those things she normally would. The patient believes they are going to do a lot worse if they don't do things they normally do to cope with their anxiety. After enacting, the patient feels much better and rates less than 30 for visibly shaking, less than they thought for going red, less than 10 for being stupid, less than 10 for visibly sweating. The patient felt much better and looked more natural after watching themselves in the video when they weren't doing any of those coping up things. ",,,,
