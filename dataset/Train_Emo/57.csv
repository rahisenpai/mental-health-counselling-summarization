"like, I think I just looked really obviously weird and out of place and like really read and just visibly shaking and sweating and kind of not being able to communicate properly with people.",story,57_7,P,id,fear
And is there anything that you do to try and kind of defend against these things to manage these problems?,routine,57_8,T,irq,fear

"I think it would be so much worse. Yeah, I think I just would just check even more and be more anxious and look of more obviously, kind of weird and out of place.",symp/reasoning,57_16,P,id,fear
"And what I'm thinking now is how do you feel about if we did an experiment to test out your thoughts on what would happen if you stopped doing these things? If we did a bit of a role play where we pretended to enact a situation at work, okay? And if we did this maybe twice and the first time, you do all the things that you normally do, okay and grip onto something, look down. And is there anything else that you do when you're in these situations, these work conversations to try and cope.",story,57_17,T,irq,fear
"And I just kind of all just like fumble and like kind of just clench, whatever, whatever it is, I'm holding just really tight and just make sure I don't make any eye contact at all, just kind of get through it.",story,57_18,P,id,fear
"Okay, so in the first time, I want you to do those things as much as you normally would, in fact, maybe even slightly more than you normally would. ",story,57_19,T,ci,fear
"Okay, ",inactive,57_20,P,ack,fear

Right. Okay,routine,57_32,P,ack,fear
"so the first column says, I need to fill out an experiment to test this thought that you have, so that our experiment is going to be that we do a conversation at work, and who should I play if you're playing yourself in this roleplay? Who should I be?",story,57_33,T,id,fear

summary,"The patient worries a lot when in social situtations, visibly shake, red and sweating. The patient tries to clench on their muscles and find something to focus on or look down and they prefer wearing black to be less obvious of worrying. The therapist requests the patient for a role-play of these situations to be enacted. On enacting the patient rates 90 on 100 for all her symptoms by doing those things she normally would. The patient believes they are going to do a lot worse if they don't do things they normally do to cope with their anxiety. After enacting, the patient feels much better and rates less than 30 for visibly shaking, less than they thought for going red, less than 10 for being stupid, less than 10 for visibly sweating. The patient felt much better and looked more natural after watching themselves in the video when they weren't doing any of those coping up things. ",,,,
