suspicious?,routine,203_27,P,crq,approval
"Yeah. So there is a gland that sort of the top of your abdomen, which is quite closely evolved, right, and called the pancreas.

All right.,inactive,203_29,P,ack,approval

"So the second scan, I showed that there definitely is something on your pancreas.",symp/reasoning,203_34,T,id,approval
Really?,inactive,203_35,P,crq,approval
"When I say something, what we worry about is whether or not this could be a cancer",routine,203_36,T,cd,approval
"god. I didn't expect that. God, I am only 47 cancer. ",routine,203_37,P,id,approval

What's the pancreas and I have got cancer. What can I can make can they cut it out?,symp/reasoning,203_41,P,irq,approval
"And it depends. And basically a pancreas is a brand that sort of sits at the top of the abdomen, as I said, and it controls some of the sort of the hormones, the fluids that your body prefers the body. Because it's at the back of the abdomen, often we don't know very much about it until it starts causing a bit of a problem, like your pain that you've been getting. So that probably explains why you've not had many other symptoms. ",symp/reasoning,203_42,T,id,approval
Right,routine,203_43,P,ack,approval
"And the answer is, I don't know what could be done about it. But we need to ask a specialist  what we usually do. This situation is asked especially today to see what has happened, think about what was cooking. Right? Do they agree that it could be potentially cancer and how do we find out what it definitely is",symp/reasoning,203_44,T,id,approval

"I suppose I could love myself. No doubt come by myself actually. Yeah, okay. It will just be easier. Feel Sure. ",routine,203_49,P,id,approval
"I mean, I think it's important to say that we don't know for definite what this is. We have to imagine that it is something like a cancer until we can prove what is right. So we do everything very quickly. Yeah, try and get some answers. Right. But we don't know any definite nothing certain in a minute. But I do appreciate that. I've just given you a little bit of time. So my door is open and yes. Okay. Have you got any questions?",symp/reasoning,203_50,T,yq,approval

"Okay,",inactive,203_53,P,ack,approval
"some of it's a little bit a little bit scary. And as I said, we don't know, nothing certain yet. I wonder if you might want to come back to see me. So what this does is it just explains a little bit about what the pancreas is right? ",routine,203_54,T,id,approval
