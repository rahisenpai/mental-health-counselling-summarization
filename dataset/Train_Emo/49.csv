and what kind of things you're doing.,routine,49_24,T,irq,amusement
"Mainly, mainly take care of home does not mean I don't I don't work or anything. So I kind of just take care of home and, you know, with the kids and everything, it's just a lot. So",story,49_25,P,id,amusement
see a lot of responsibilities in the home.,routine,49_26,T,crq,amusement
Guess all of the responsibilities all,routine,49_27,P,cd,amusement

"I'm cooking, I'm cleaning.",routine,49_30,P,id,amusement
"Now I have to earn all of my husband's uniforms and get everything ready for him. I had to make sure I cook breakfast I had to make sure I pick lunch. I had to make sure I have dinner ready income I had to help the kids with their homework.

Okay. Where you're really just doing everything in the home.,routine,49_34,T,irq,amusement
Everything.,inactive,49_35,P,id,amusement
I want to ask you,routine,49_36,T,irq,amusement
"Can I ask you or mention a few words? Right? I would like you to, if you're okay with this exercise, tell me the first thing that comes to mind like and you can buy say a word, you can offer several responses. But try not to invest a lot of thought into the response more just what occurs to you. Oh, but does that make sense? ",story,49_37,T,irq,amusement
Yeah.,routine,49_38,P,ack,amusement
All right. So the first word is,routine,49_39,T,irq,amusement
"structure, responsibility.",routine,49_40,P,id,amusement
"repetition,",routine,49_41,P,id,annoyance
repetition.,routine,49_42,T,crq,annoyance
"All right. Let me give you another word, relationship.",routine,49_43,T,irq,amusement
"conflict, power struggle.",routine,49_44,P,id,annoyance
disagreements.,routine,49_45,P,id,annoyance
Let me offer you another word,routine,49_46,T,irq,amusement
work.,routine,49_47,T,irq,amusement
"Independence,",routine,49_48,P,id,amusement
freedom,routine,49_49,P,id,amusement
able to express creativity.,routine,49_50,P,id,amusement
"Good, alright. How about another word here? Power",routine,49_51,T,irq,amusement
of constant struggle,routine,49_52,P,id,annoyance
extremely controlling.,routine,49_53,P,id,annoyance
So do you see any,routine,49_54,T,irq,amusement
themes and in the words that you provided back,routine,49_55,T,irq,amusement
Seems like everything is like really controlled and,routine,49_56,P,id,annoyance
"structured, ",routine,49_57,P,id,amusement
controlled and structured?,routine,49_58,T,irq,amusement
What's the source of that controlling structure? Is there a source of it?,symp/reasoning,49_59,T,irq,annoyance
A lot of it may come from my fiance. Now that I'm thinking about it.,symp/reasoning,49_60,P,id,amusement
"Somebody told me you're thinking,",routine,49_61,T,gc,amusement
"because I feel that he doesn't give me the freedom or the ability to do a lot of the things that I would like to do like work, and I think he should help more with the kids around the house and do things and I shouldn't have to do everything. And I feel like that's probably why I'm so frustrated because I felt that I don't have any help. It's like I'm single, and I'm doing everything on my own. So this project where the bulk of my frustration is coming from",story,49_62,P,id,annoyance
So as you're telling me this and you're explaining kind of that relationship with your fiance What are you feeling?,routine,49_63,T,irq,amusement
"I'm feeling angry and disappointed. Like I don't really know if I want to further anything because well it'd be like this forever just like angry, frustrated",symp/reasoning,49_64,P,id,annoyance
is a similar to the anger that you've been experiencing recently. Like at the dry cleaner places.,symp/reasoning,49_65,T,gc,annoyance
It's far worse than it but it's like I think that's where why I'm always so upset and angry.,symp/reasoning,49_66,P,gc,annoyance
Serious thinking that maybe that relationship or something part of that relationship is what's really causing the anger.,symp/reasoning,49_67,T,gc,annoyance
"Yeah, cuz I feel alone at the same time completely. Like I'm not in a fair relationship is like I'm in control and I don't have freedom to do anything. I don't have help and it's just it's laying a lot of stress on me.",symp/reasoning,49_68,P,gc,admiration
So is this is your talk about this do you feel like this is new information you're kind of realizing something that you didn't realize before,symp/reasoning,49_69,T,crq,amusement
"it because honestly, I kind of I never really focused on that aspect of it. I kind of just thought that's the way it should go. And I just thought I was angry because I just hate bad deeds. I've never really looked deep into it because I try so hard to make everything in my family, right. So I kind of really don't pay attention, I kind of ignore it. But now that I'm thinking and pointing out different things, than into how I really feel.",symp/reasoning,49_70,P,cd,annoyance
"So you feel this, this kind of big moment in terms of awareness.",routine,49_71,T,crq,amusement
"Definitely because I don't think I would have like I said, I think I'm kind of try to hide it and really don't focus much on it because I want things to be perfect. So they got a kind of ignore it.",story,49_72,P,cd,amusement
"Okay, so maybe through this session, you develop more insight about what's contributing to the anger.",routine,49_73,T,orq,amusement
"Yeah, definitely. Cuz I would just go off for no reason at all and just later to think about like, why did I even do it?",routine,49_74,P,od,annoyance
"But But this source of anchor, this relationship, you recognize this is maybe more causal or more contributing? Yeah. Where's the other objects of your ad? If you weren't really sure,",routine,49_75,T,irq,amusement
"I wasn't sure at all. Why. But with that, I definitely could see the reasons why.",routine,49_76,P,id,amusement
"All right, chess move. I feel like we've made some progress here. And I'd like you to between now and next session, if you're comfortable with it, kind of reflect on what themes have maybe come to the surface, what informations may have been revealed to you a little bit. And we can pick up there and explore this further with the anger issue. So that's like a good plan.",story,49_77,T,gc,amusement
"Yeah, definitely. Definitely. It's good.",inactive,49_78,P,ack,amusement
"Well, I appreciate you coming in today, and I'll see you in week. Okay. Thank you.",inactive,49_79,T,gt,amusement
