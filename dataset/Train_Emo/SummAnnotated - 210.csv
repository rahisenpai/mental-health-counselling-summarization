I can't catch my breath and it's making me feel funny talking to you about And so my heart starts to race. I can't get my breath and I get chest pain. I  get very afraid.

Okay. And can you remember what happened to start it all off?,story,16.0,T,irq,amusement
"Well, I think we have had some problems at work. And I felt more stressed about work than I normally do. And basically, I was just trying to get into town one day on a day off and it was very hot, very funny, hot days and it just happened. My heart just started. to race and race and race and I couldn't get my breath, I was just like gasping for breath. Then I start to get chest pains and it was just awful. And I managed to sit down and call my husband and he, he came out, he actually left work to come and get me. ",story,17.0,P,id,admiration
Right. So that sounds like quite an unpleasant experience.,inactive,18.0,T,crq,admiration
"Its was awful It frightenining, yeah",inactive,19.0,P,cd,approval
"and when that was happening to Julie, when you're in the middle of town, what was it that you thought was going on? ",story,20.0,T,irq,annoyance
I thought I was having a heart attack I'm so afraid that that's is what's happening.,story,21.0,P,id,approval
Right Okay.,inactive,22.0,T,ack,amusement
"So you know, start to try to avoid situations where I might get like that they see ya. ",inactive,23.0,P,gc,annoyance
So what kind of things are you finding yourself avoiding?,story,24.0,T,irq,annoyance
I can't get into town now without my husband taking me My husband has to take me to from work. And then I also thought I shouldn't do anything to put any strain on my heart at all. So I don't do much exercise or anything at the moment or other things as well,story,25.0,P,id,annoyance
"and other things, what sort of things you are not doing?",symp/reasoning,26.0,T,irq,annoyance
"personal things, personal things. ",symp/reasoning,27.0,P,id,annoyance
Okay. I guess I'm wondering if you're talking about your sex life there.,symp/reasoning,28.0,T,crq,amusement
Yeah.,inactive,29.0,P,ack,amusement
Right.,inactive,30.0,T,ack,amusement
"Now I just feel, you know that I shouldn't do anything like that, because it just might put too much strain on me.",symp/reasoning,31.0,P,od,admiration
So you're avoiding sex in case that puts your heart rate up.,symp/reasoning,32.0,T,crq,annoyance
yeah yeah,inactive,33.0,P,ack,amusement
"Okay, How's that affecting things between you and your husband?",routine,34.0,T,irq,amusement
"My husband's getting really fed up with it to be honest. He's been really, really kind and really supportive. But I think it's starting to affect his life quite a lot now. So he wanted me to go to the pub last week and absolutely promised that I would, because I've begun to stop wanting to go out because I'm so afraid it's gonna happen. I promised and promised him I go to the pub. And then when it came to it, I just couldn't. I just sat on the sofa and it started happening again. And then I was worried that if I went to the pub, I'd actually like get ill in the pub. And then it's really embarrassing for everybody. So just that I couldn't go in, and I think he's getting a bit To the end of his tetanus because it just seems to come out of the blue. And I've never suffered from anything like this before.",routine,35.0,P,id,approval
It sounds like he's getting to the end of his tether because it also sounds like you're pretty fed up with the whole thing as well. Julie,routine,36.0,T,crq,amusement
"Yeah, right. Yeah, yeah. ",inactive,37.0,P,cd,amusement
"So just so that I've got the story straight. This all began about six months ago. Before that, had you had anything like this? ",routine,38.0,T,crq,amusement
"No, not at all. I mean, I think we had a new manager at work, I work in a bank only and then we had a new computer system put in and so it became very much stressful for all the staff not just me. And that's I can sort of see that I was in a lot more pressure and that could be affecting me.",routine,39.0,P,on,annoyance
"So just to make sure I've got the right the right way around. It began six months ago, pressure at work went to town you had the first of these attacks. And then since then you've had some more and now it's kind of got to the point that you don't want to go out to don't get to town by yourself. ",routine,40.0,T,crq,amusement
"No, I don't want to risk it to be honest. ",symp/reasoning,41.0,P,cd,amusement
"You know, you don't go to the pub, not socializing like you used to and you avoiding things like exercise and things like sex and having a bit of a taking its toll on your relationship. ",symp/reasoning,42.0,T,gc,annoyance
Yeah yeah yeah.,inactive,43.0,P,ack,amusement
"Okay. Okay. And looking at your I know, you've had an ECG, Dr. Jones, organized for you a couple of months ago. ",symp/reasoning,44.0,T,yq,amusement
Yeah,inactive,45.0,P,ack,amusement
What have you been told about the results of that?,symp/reasoning,46.0,T,irq,annoyance
"Well Dr. Jones said that it was okay. And there were no problems. And, you know, I did feel relief, you know, because, obviously, there's been events in my family, my dad died of one, you know, 72. So I'm thinking it must be my heart. There must be something wrong with it right now. It did feel pleased when Dr. Jones said that. But on the other hand, nothing's changed. You know, I'm still getting exactly the same problems. Nothing, you know, not getting any help with it. I just feel a bit like well, so I haven't got a bad heart according to the experts, but I'm still getting all the same symptoms you kow worse and worse.",symp/reasoning,47.0,P,id,amusement
"So even though the your GP told you there's no, there's nothing to worry about with your heart. Do you still worry that There might be something wrong with your heart?",routine,48.0,T,crq,approval
I can't understand it. What do you think of Dr. Julia?,routine,49.0,P,on,annoyance
"I think I agree with Dr. Jones. I don't think there is anything wrong with your heart. The reason I say that is that you've had an ECG, which has come back perfectly normal. And usually if there was a problem with the heart the ECG would pick something up. Also, you've got none of the risk factors really for heart disease, because you you don't smoke, your blood pressure, from what I can gather from you notes has always been fine. You're fairly young. Before this, you were pretty fit and active. And also, I know you're worried about your dad having had a heart attack, but actually, he was a lot older than you are. And so you're not really in the same risk sort of bracket as he would have been. ",symp/reasoning,50.0,T,od,amusement
Right.,inactive,51.0,P,ack,amusement
"So I don't think that there is a problem with your heart. I guess what I'm what Is weather actually, what's going on is a little bit more what Dr. Jones thought weather actually this, this might be the anxiety that's giving you a lot of these symptoms. Have you ever thought it might be that rather than a heart problem?",symp/reasoning,52.0,T,od,approval
"I think I've been thinking more recently, it could be because my friend has like panic attacks. I've discussed it with her and she said, to be honest, it just sounds like that. I've always thought it was my heart. And what I can't understand is how my brain is making my heart start racing like it is. ",symp/reasoning,53.0,P,id,approval
It's right. Okay. Has anyone explained to about anxiety and panic attacks?,routine,54.0,T,irq,amusement
I don't really know.,routine,55.0,P,on,approval
"Okay, well, perhaps it would be helpful to sort of hear a little bit more about that. What we have on top of our kidneys is two little glands and they called our adrenal glands. ",routine,56.0,T,id,amusement
Right.,inactive,57.0,P,ack,amusement
And they produce a hormone called adrenalin. Have you heard of that?,routine,58.0,T,yq,amusement
" Yes, I have heard of that",inactive,59.0,P,ack,amusement
okay. And what adrenalin does is it prepares us for situations of fight or flight? Is that a term you perhaps remember from biology at school?,routine,60.0,T,yq,amusement
I do. I do. Yeah. I Do,inactive,61.0,P,ack,amusement
you remember what we mean by fight or flies?,routine,62.0,T,irq,annoyance
"I think like, if you're in a scary situation, you fight or you run away, basically your body sort of triggers that.",routine,63.0,P,id,approval
Yeah,inactive,64.0,T,ack,amusement
to do it.,inactive,65.0,P,gc,amusement
"Yes, exactly. It's what's released to allow you to do the flight or fight response in the adrenaline. So when your body needs to get ready to do something, it's surges out a load of adrenaline, and the adrenaline basically gets you ready for action. ",routine,66.0,T,ack,amusement
Right.,inactive,67.0,P,ack,amusement
"So it does things like it puts your heart rate up, it makes your breathing speed up, you're ready to run. It can sometimes make people feel as though their mouth is dry. It can sometimes make people feel a bit lightheaded. But those are the kinds of symptoms that you can get.",symp/reasoning,68.0,T,gc,admiration
All of those actually Okay.,inactive,69.0,P,ack,amusement
"What often happens with people with panic is that the first time that happens the first adrenaline release Out of the blue, perhaps at times of stress, and you mentioned that there was stuff going on at work, and you're feeling a bit stressed out and you're in town, it was a bit hot. So that may have been what was behind that very first panic attack. What happens to people is that once they've had one panic attack, they go on to have more. ",symp/reasoning,70.0,T,gc,admiration
Hmm.,inactive,71.0,P,ack,amusement
"And the reason for that is that once you've had something like that happen to you, you're kind of there thinking, Oh, will this happen again? ",symp/reasoning,72.0,T,gc,annoyance
"Is that something that you are Absolutely sure. I have started to really monitor my heart And when it starts to race, I start to get worried. And then it starts getting faster and faster So it does feel that's",symp/reasoning,73.0,P,gc,amusement
"Yeah, you describing it Exactly. Julie, that's what we call hyper vigilance. So you they're kind of keeping a bit of an eye on your heart. And for most of us, our heart rate will go up and down all through the day, but most of us don't worry about it, because we don't notice it. ",symp/reasoning,74.0,T,ack,amusement
Right.,inactive,75.0,P,ack,amusement
"But because you've had a panic attack you they're thinking, What's my heart doing? ",symp/reasoning,76.0,T,crq,approval
Yeah.,inactive,77.0,P,ack,amusement
"And then the minute it starts to change, you clock it You notice it, and then you start to get anxious thoughts, you might worry And",symp/reasoning,78.0,T,gc,approval
"I really start worrying, thinking thinking, is it going to be now? You know, is my heart gonna stop beating",symp/reasoning,79.0,P,gc,annoyance
"Right, So you get those kinds of anxious and they're very frightening, because you're thinking, Oh, my goodness me could my heart's on that makes you even more anxious, and that causes even more adrenalin to be released. ",symp/reasoning,80.0,T,gc,approval
Right,inactive,81.0,P,ack,amusement
And that makes the symptoms even more pronounced. And then that makes you believe even more that there's something wrong with you. Does that make sense to what might be happening?,routine,82.0,T,od,approval
It does make sense doctor,routine,83.0,P,ack,amusement
"One of the things that you have been doing, which is something that a lot of people with anxiety do is that you've started to, to avoid doing things that trigger it off. ",symp/reasoning,84.0,T,od,approval
"Yeah, like not walking to town or anything like that anymore. ",symp/reasoning,85.0,P,crq,amusement
"Exactly. And whilst in the short term that sort of alleviates your symptoms, because you don't have to get panicky, what's happening is that the more you avoid doing things, the less likely you are to ever get round to finding out whether or not anything awful, really happens. ",symp/reasoning,86.0,T,ack,approval
Right yeah.,inactive,87.0,P,ack,amusement
Does that make sense?,inactive,88.0,T,yq,amusement
It Does. it just makes sense,inactive,89.0,P,ack,amusement
"Well, if we all started to tackle this as if it was an anxiety problem, there are a number of approaches, we can think about tablets. And we're gonna think about other kind of talking approaches. There are pros and cons to those and side effects and things that we need to discuss. So I'm just slightly watchful of the time, we seem to be coming to the end of today's session for the appointment, but all right, well, I wonder is whether we should meet again, perhaps next week, and look again, more carefully at some of the treatment options and think together about which might suit you best. ",routine,90.0,T,id,amusement
Okay,inactive,91.0,P,ack,amusement
how would that sound?,inactive,92.0,T,yq,amusement
"You know, that's fine. That's fine. ",inactive,93.0,P,ack,amusement
Any other questions before we end this session,inactive,94.0,T,yq,annoyance
"No, I will make an appointment to see you next week",inactive,95.0,P,ack,amusement
I'll see you next week.,inactive,96.0,T,gc,amusement
"Okay, thank you, doctor. ",inactive,97.0,P,gt,amusement
Pleasure. All right.,inactive,98.0,T,gt,amusement
Bye bye.,inactive,99.0,P,gt,amusement
